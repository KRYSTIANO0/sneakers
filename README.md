# SNEAKERS

## :scroll:DESCRIPTION

I used NextJS to create Sneakers. In this project, I extended my knowledge of database connection. Specifically with MongoDB. The site is divided into women's and men's segments. Specific shoes can be added to favorites or to cart. There are a lot of flavors on the site so feel free!
